Functional Programming:

Pure function: A function that doesn't have an external state and return the same output every time for the same input
Ex:
square(x){
return x*x
}

This is not pure:
y+1;

func(x){
y = y+1

return x+y
}


When to use FP vs OOP?
A: Use FP for rest API (cuz rest= stateless).ackend doesn't store http
+) Promises & Callback: is related to FP (to escape call back hell)
